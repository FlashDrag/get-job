# Get Job
## Overview
The relevance of job search in our time constantly increases. [Get Job](http://get-job.live) is an online Job Platform that helps Jobseekers to get a desirable job and Employers to find the right candidates. The app includes two modes: _Jobseeker Mode_ and _Employer Mode_. _Jobseeker Mode_ allows users to search for jobs and apply for jobs as well as create their resume and manage their applications. And _Employer Mode_ allows users to post jobs, search for candidates and hire them. The *Get Job* portal is designed to be simple and intuitive so that users can easily navigate the app and perform the desired actions.

### Agile methodology
This project was developed with the Agile methodology which allowed me to develop the app in an iterative and incremental way, and adapt changes with flexibility even in the late stages of development.

_GitHub Issues_ and _Projects_ are used to manage the development process. Each part of the app divided into _Epics_ which are broken down into _User Stories_ and _Tasks_. An Epic represents a large body of work, such as a feature.

Each Epic is developed in a separate branch and merged to the master branch after testing and debugging and then deployed to the production server on _Heroku_. The _master_ branch is always production-ready and all changes are deployed automatically to the production server. This helps isolate development of each feature and minimize the risk of breaking the production code. The feature branches merged to the _master_ branch using _Pull Requests_ which allows to review the code and test the changes before merging.

_GitHub Kanban_ board is used to track the progress of the development process. When _User Story_ is created, it is automatically added to the _Backlog_ column to be prioritized. The product _Backlog_ is never complete, as it is dynamic document to respond to changes effectively. As new features are identified, they are added to the product _Backlog_. As the product is released, the product _Backlog_ is constantly updated to reflect changes in the product and changes in the market. The Kanban board includes the following columns:
- **Backlog** - the list of all _User Stories_ that has not yet been scheduled to be completed. As new _User Stories_ are created, they are automatically added to the _Backlog_ column.
- **Development** - the collection of prioritized _User Stories_ that have to be completed before the end of the current _Sprint_.
- **Testing** - user stories that are currently being tested.
- **Done** - all completed and tested _User Stories_.

The _User Stories_ prioritized using the _MoSCoW_ method and moved to the _Sprint Backlog_ column and added to the _Milstone_. The prioritation was based on the following criteria:
- **Must Have** - The _User Story_ is crucial and add significant value to the product and must be delivered in the current iteration.
- **Should Have** - The _User Story_ is important but not critical to the success. Simply delivery is not guaranteed within the current iteration.
- **Could Have** - The _User Story_ is desirable and would only be delivered in their entirety in a best-case scenario. When a problem occurs and the deadline is at risk, one or more could-have items are dropped.
- **Won't Have** - The _User Story_ will not be delivered in the current delivery timebox, but may be considered for the future.

To balance the distribution of work in the current iteration, 60% of the effort was allocated to the _Must Have_, 20% to the _Should Have_, 20% to the _Could Have_.

_Milestones_ were used to group issues into sprints. Each _Sprint_ had a due date. When the _Sprint_ starts, the _Milestone_ is created and the _User Stories_ are added to the _Milestone_ and. _User Stories_ are prioritized using the _MoSCoW_ method and moved to the _Development_ column.
Then  After the development is completed, the _User Stories_ are moved to the _Testing_ column. When the testing is successfully completed, the _User Stories_ closed using _commit_ message with reference to the User Story ID.

### Structure
The Get Job platform based on the intuitive and easy to use structure. Every page has a consistent layout and navigation to allow users to easily find the information they need. The app has a responsive design to provide an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices.

- The Jobseeker's and Employer's Navbar structures are similar but have different purposes. The Jobseeker can search for jobs and the Employer can search for resumes as well as Jobseeker can create a resume and the Employer can create a job post.
- The index page of the app is a Jobseeker home page which can be toggled to Employer home page. The Jobseeker and the Employer home pages structure is similar. The difference is only in the content of the pages.
- The login page contains a indentical login form for jobseekers and employers but user has to select the role before login.
- The register forms are different for jobseekers and employers as they include different fields.
- The List of Resumes and the List of Jobs page structures are identical. The difference is also only in the content of the pages.
- The app also includes separate Detailed pages of the Resume and the Job.
- Jobseekers and Employers have own Profile pages to manage their accounts and view their resumes and created jobs.

### UI Design
...


## Features
Since the User always visits the site for some content and for some purpose, the Features of the app primarily designed solve the problems of the Jobseekers and Employers and help them to achieve their goals. The UX is designed to create single-use learning and does not distract users attention from the main goal - to find a job or a candidate.

- #### Jobseeker's Search bar
The one of the important features of the app is the search bar. Like a google search bar, it placed in the center of the page to be easily found and allows users to achieve their main goal - to find a job, quickly and easily.

### Agile methodology
This project was developed with the Agile methodology which allowed me to develop the app in an iterative and incremental way, and adapt changes with flexibility even in the late stages of development.

_GitHub Issues_ and _Projects_ are used to manage the development process. Each part of the app divided into _Epics_ which are broken down into _User Stories_ and _Tasks_. An Epic represents a large body of work, such as a feature.

Each Epic is developed in a separate branch and merged to the master branch after testing and debugging and then deployed to the production server on _Heroku_.

_GitHub Kanban_ board is used to track the progress of the development process. When _User Story_ is created, it is automatically added to the _Backlog_ column to be prioritized. The product _Backlog_ is never complete, as it is dynamic document to respond to changes effectively. As new features are identified, they are added to the product _Backlog_. As the product is released, the product _Backlog_ is constantly updated to reflect changes in the product and changes in the market. The Kanban board includes the following columns:
- **Backlog** - the list of all _User Stories_ that has not yet been scheduled to be completed. As new _User Stories_ are created, they are automatically added to the _Backlog_ column.
- **Development** - the collection of prioritized _User Stories_ that have to be completed before the end of the current _Sprint_.
- **Testing** - user stories that are currently being tested.
- **Done** - all completed and tested _User Stories_.

The _User Stories_ prioritized using the _MoSCoW_ method and moved to the _Sprint Backlog_ column and added to the _Milstone_. The prioritation was based on the following criteria:
- **Must Have** - The _User Story_ is crucial and add significant value to the product and must be delivered in the current iteration.
- **Should Have** - The _User Story_ is important but not critical to the success. Simply delivery is not guaranteed within the current iteration.
- **Could Have** - The _User Story_ is desirable and would only be delivered in their entirety in a best-case scenario. When a problem occurs and the deadline is at risk, one or more could-have items are dropped.
- **Won't Have** - The _User Story_ will not be delivered in the current delivery timebox, but may be considered for the future.

To balance the distribution of work in the current iteration, 60% of the effort was allocated to the _Must Have_, 20% to the _Should Have_, 20% to the _Could Have_.

_Milestones_ were used to group issues into sprints. Each _Sprint_ had a due date. When the _Sprint_ starts, the _Milestone_ is created and the _User Stories_ are added to the _Milestone_ and. _User Stories_ are prioritized using the _MoSCoW_ method and moved to the _Development_ column.
Then  After the development is completed, the _User Stories_ are moved to the _Testing_ column. When the testing is successfully completed, the _User Stories_ closed using _commit_ message with reference to the User Story ID.
